# EvaluationMetrics

This project includes various evaluation metrics, tipically used in NLP, IR, and ML.

The current version is more focused on IR. Therefore, it includes implementations
of average precision, precision and recall at k, mean average precision, and mean
reciprocal rank. 

It can be used out of the box to evaluate systems in for the ECML 2016 cQA Challenge:
